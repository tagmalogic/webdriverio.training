Git Setup and Cheat sheet

What is Git: A source version control system
Why we need it: Code related training resources are hosted in GitHub and we need Git installed to clone the repository locally.
Official resources: https://git-scm.com/

-------------------------------

Setup - install Git

git --version - check if Git is installed and the version

OR if not installed

Download and install it from https://git-scm.com/

At this stage you should be ready for the course prerequisites.

Below are a few extra commands as a cheat sheet to have at hand for your future needs.
