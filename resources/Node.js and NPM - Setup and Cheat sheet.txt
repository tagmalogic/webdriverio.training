Node.js and NPM Cheat sheet and Setup

What is Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime 
Why we need it: WebdriverIO uses Node.js
Official resources: https://nodejs.org/en/

What is NPM: Node Package Manager
Why we need it: To install various node packages including the ones used by Webdriver.io
Official resources: https://www.npmjs.com/

-------------------------------

Setup - install Node.js and NPM

Depending on the WebdriverIO version a specific version of Node.js is needed. Node.js installation will include NPM as well.
I recommend installing the current LTS version found at: https://nodejs.org/en/. Follow the instructions on website.

Check Node.js version and that it was installed correctly
node --version

Check NPM version and that it was installed correctly
npm --version

At this stage you should be ready for the course prerequisites.
