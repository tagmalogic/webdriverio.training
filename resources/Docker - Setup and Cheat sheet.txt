At this stage you should be ready for the course prerequisites. 

-------------------------------

Below are a few extra commands as a cheat sheet to have at hand for your future needs.

It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of commands of Docker Desktop and Docker Compose.

Check the installed Docker version
docker --version

Check the Docker Compose version
docker-compose --version

Start the containers defined in docker-compose.yml file. It should be in the same folder
docker-compose up -d

Stop containers started earlier without losing any data
docker-compose stop

Start the earlier stopped containers
docker-compose start

Dispose the containers but keep the volumes (so you don't need to set up WordPress again when you bring them up)
docker-compose down

Dispose the containers and volumes (you will need to reconfigure WordPress when  bring them up again)
docker-compose down --volumes

See docker images present on your system
docker images

Remove image that is not used by any containers
docker rmi <image id>

ATTENTION:
Be extremely careful with Docker containers and Docker images that you have on your system and don't want to lose.
If you are not sure about one command better read more about it or avoid executing it.
